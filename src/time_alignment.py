## AJS's Super Audio Aligner
# This function time-aligns different audio clips recorded under different conditions
# In this implementation, a folder of audios are aligned against a reference audio, 
# and then export the aligned audios to a designated folder

# Use Case: This was originally developed for the Far-Field Audio Synthesis Toolkit (FAST)
# We have wanted to examine the frequency response when audio is recorded through a fabric
# So experiments were conducted to collect recordings of sine sweep-s when they are passed through certain fabrics
# However, because the recordings might start at different point of the clips, we will need to align them
# Conventionally, people uses a loud impulse (Like the "ACTION" during filming) to time align different recordings
# Since this is not done at the point of the experiment, we relied on spectrogram cross-corcelation to time-align

# For consistency, do note that we should deliberately introduce a lag to 
# the audio to be aligned against the reference audio
# i.e. The reference audio i s always "ahead"
# This can be done using a simple audio editing tool such as audacity
# This is a measure to prevent removing useful portions of the audios we wish to align

# Note to self: This was FUCKING cool when you finally got it to work!
# The absence of a ready package doing this already is so surprising!
# Perhaps publish a python package for it?
